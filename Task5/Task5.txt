Comparing Node.js Modules: http, https, and http2:
1) purpose of each module
 http: enable create a server or send requests using the standard HTTP/1.1 protocol — no encryption or extra security.
 https: Same as `http` but with TLS/SSL encryption, so the data between the server and the client is secure.
 http2: Uses the newer HTTP/2 protocol, which improves speed and performance by sending multiple requests in the same connection and compressing data.

2) Key technical differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
HTTP/1.1: Each request is sent separately; a slow request can block others.
HTTP/2: Multiple requests can run at the same time over a single connection (multiplexing) — much faster.
HTTP/2 compresses headers and supports **Server Push**, where the server can send files before the client asks for them.

3)When to Use Each
http: For testing, small internal services, or when security is not needed.
https: For public-facing websites or services that need to protect user data.
http2: For large projects, high-performance APIs, or apps that need faster load times.
